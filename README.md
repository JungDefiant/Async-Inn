### Architecture Pattern
This program is designed to manipulate data between a database and a client via a web connection.

<br /><br />DbContext --> These are the data sets and the seed for a database
<br />Entities --> These are data objects on the .NET/C# side that represent data from a database
<br />Repositories --> These are handlers that determine how data is loaded from the database and returned to objects on the .NET side where the repository is being used
<br />Controllers --> These are handlers that determine how data is dealt with via HTTP requests, including GET, POST, PUT, and Delete

### Route Examples
Different routes return specific data objects.
